  <h1>Hello, I'm Sebastian.</h1>
  <p>I'm an Australian developer working with open-source software. I believe websites should be fast for everyone, simple, secure and not evade the privacy of it's users. I intend to make the web a safer place one website at at time, following the industry's best practices.</p>

  <p>My open sourced and contributed projects are available on <a href="https://github.com/publicarray/">Github</a>. If you prefer you can also check out a nicer looking <a href="https://resume.github.io/?publicarray">résumé representation of my Github profile</a>.</p>
